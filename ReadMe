Nashville Housing Data Analysis and Cleaning Project

Overview:
This project demonstrates my expertise in data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL on a real-world dataset: Nashville Housing. My goal was to standardize, clean, and enhance the dataset, making it ready for sophisticated data analysis and business intelligence applications. This project showcases advanced data manipulation techniques, ensuring data integrity, and deriving actionable insights.

Project Objectives:
*Standardize Date Formats: Convert inconsistent date formats into a standardized DATE format, enabling accurate time-series analysis.
*Populate Missing Property Address Data: Fill in missing property addresses by cross-referencing other records with the same ParcelID.
*Split Address into Components: Decompose the PropertyAddress field into PropertySplitAddress and PropertySplitCity for more granular location analysis.
*Standardize 'Sold As Vacant' Field: Normalize the SoldAsVacant field for consistency across records, converting 'Y' and 'N' into 'Yes' and 'No'.
*Remove Duplicate Records: Identify and delete duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and avoid skewed analysis.
*Delete Unused Columns: Streamline the dataset by removing unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
*Identify and Handle Outliers in Sale Prices: Detect and manage outliers in the SalePrice column, ensuring robust statistical analysis.
*Normalize Numerical Data: Implement min-max normalization on SalePrice to enable comparisons across different scales.
*Advanced Data Aggregation for Business Insights: Calculate average sale prices by neighborhood and identify the most common property types sold, providing valuable insights for market trends.
*Data Validation and Integrity Checks: Perform rigorous validation checks to ensure data completeness, accuracy, and consistency, and enforce unique constraints on critical fields.

Conclusion:
This project exemplifies my ability to handle complex data cleaning and transformation tasks, preparing datasets for high-quality analysis.
